## ✨ Overview

**DSAverse** isn’t just a collection — it’s a **mission log** of my journey to master DSA from the ground up.  
Every problem here is dissected with clarity, solved with intent, and written with clean Java code.  
Whether you're preparing for **FAANG**, **startups**, or aiming for solid foundations — this is your companion.

Each solution includes:

- 🧠 Intuition & Thought Process  
- 🔍 Step-by-Step Approach  
- ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity  
- 💻 Optimized Java Code with Explanations
